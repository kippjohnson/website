Research in precision cardiovascular medicine
======
--->
I use data and machine intelligence to solve important problems in medicine and healthcare. I focus especially on chronic cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

I work at the [Institute for Next Generation Healthcare](http://www.nextgenhealthcare.org/) under the supervision of [Joel Dudley, PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Dudley).

Browse and download my [publications](https://kippjohnson.com/publications/) or use [email](kipp.william.johnson@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kippwjohnson/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kippwjohnson) to get in touch with me.
