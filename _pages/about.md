I am a physician in the [physician-scientist training program (PSTP)](https://www.medicine.northwestern.edu/education/residents/residency-experience/pstp.html) in the Department of Medicine at Northwestern University.

I use data and statistical learning to solve problems in medicine and healthcare. My work focuses especially on cardiovascular and metabolic disease. 

Previously I was  employed at [Tempus Labs](https://www.tempus.com/). Before that, I earned my MD and PhD at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Joel Dudley, PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Dudley).
