I use data and machine intelligence to solve important problems in medicine and healthcare. I work at the [Institute for Next Generation Healthcare](http://www.nextgenhealthcare.org/) at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/) under the supervision of [Joel Dudley, PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Dudley). My work focuses especially on chronic cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

I am currently accepting consulting work in drug discovery and/or artificial intelligence in healthcare.
