Research in precision cardiovascular medicine
======
--->

Hi! You have reached the website of Kipp W. Johnson.

I am an MD/PhD candidate at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/), a medical school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City. I currently work in the laboratory of Joel T. Dudley, the director of the [Institute for Next Generation Healthcare](http://www.nextgenhealthcare.org/).

My work focuses on the application of concepts drawn from statistics, machine learning, and computer science to enable better and more precise healthcare, especially in the context of cardiovascular disease.
