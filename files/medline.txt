AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most serious complication of
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to
      characterize pathology of PAD in below- and above-knee amputation specimens in
      patients presenting with CLI. METHODS: Peripheral arteries from 95 patients (121 
      amputation specimens) were examined; 75 patients had presented with CLI, and the 
      remaining 20 had amputations performed for other reasons. The pathological
      characteristics were separately recorded for femoral and popliteal arteries
      (FEM-POP), and infrapopliteal arteries (INFRA-POP). RESULTS: A total of 299
      arteries were examined. In the 239 arteries from CLI patients, atherosclerotic
      plaques were more frequent in FEM-POP (23 of 34, 67.6%) compared with INFRA-POP
      (79 of 205, 38.5%) arteries. Of these 239 arteries, 165 (69%) showed >/=70%
      stenosis, which was due to significant pathological intimal thickening,
      fibroatheroma, fibrocalcific lesions, or restenosis in 45 of 165 (27.3%), or was 
      due to luminal thrombi with (39 of 165, 23.6%) or without (81 of 165, 49.1%)
      significant atherosclerotic lesions. Presence of chronic luminal thrombi was more
      frequently observed in arteries with insignificant atherosclerosis (OR: 16.7; p =
      0.0002), more so in INFRA-POP compared with FEM-POP (OR: 2.14; p = 0.0041)
      arteries. Acute thrombotic occlusion was less frequently encountered in INFRA-POP
      than FEM-POP arteries (OR: 0.27; p = 0.0067). Medial calcification was present in
      170 of 239 (71.1%) large arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic luminal occlusion
      associated with insignificant atherosclerosis is commonly observed in CLI and
      suggests the possibility of thromboembolic disease. The pathological
      characteristics of arteries in CLI suggest possible mechanisms of progression of 
      PAD to CLI, especially in INFRA-POP arteries, and may support the preventive role
      of antithrombotic agents.

TI  - Incidence and aetiology of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1-59months in

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide among children aged 1-59months. We aimed to describe its
      burden in South Asia, focusing on vaccine-preventable aetiologies. METHODS: We
      searched five databases for studies published from January 1, 1990, to April 25, 
      2017. We estimated incidence and aetiology-specific proportions using
      random-effects meta-analysis. In secondary analyses, we described vaccine impact 
      and pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. RESULTS: We included 48 articles
      cumulatively reporting 20,707 cases from 1987 to 2013. Mean annual incidence was 
      105 (95% confidence interval [CI], 53-173) cases per 100,000 children. On
      average, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) accounted for 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) of
      cases, pneumococcus for 10% (95% CI, 6-15%), and meningococcus for 1% (95% CI,
      0-2%). These meta-analyses had substantial between-study heterogeneity (I(2)>78%,
      P<0.0001). Among studies reporting only confirmed cases, these three bacteria
      caused a median of 78% cases (IQR, 50-87%). Hib meningitis incidence declined by 
      72-83% at sentinel hospitals in Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively, within two
      years of implementing nationwide vaccination. On average, PCV10 covered 49% (95% 
      CI, 39-58%), PCV13 covered 51% (95% CI, 40-61%), and PPSV23 covered 74% (95% CI, 
      67-80%) of pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. Lower PCV10 and PCV13 serotype
      coverage in Bangladesh was associated with higher prevalence of serotype 2,
      compared to India and Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: South Asia has relatively high
      incidence of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1-59months, with
      vaccine-preventable bacteria causing a substantial proportion. These estimates
      are likely underestimates due to multiple epidemiological and microbiological
      factors. Further research on vaccine impact and distribution of pneumococcal
      serotypes will inform vaccine policymaking and implementation.

TI  - Systematic analyses of drugs and disease indications in RepurposeDB reveal
      pharmacological, biological and epidemiological factors influencing drug
      repositioning.
PG  - 656-678
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbw136 [doi]
AB  - Increase in global population and growing disease burden due to the emergence of 
      infectious diseases (Zika virus), multidrug-resistant pathogens, drug-resistant
      cancers (cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer) and chronic diseases (arterial
      hypertension) necessitate effective therapies to improve health outcomes.
      However, the rapid increase in drug development cost demands innovative and
      sustainable drug discovery approaches. Drug repositioning, the discovery of new
      or improved therapies by reevaluation of approved or investigational compounds,
      solves a significant gap in the public health setting and improves the
      productivity of drug development. As the number of drug repurposing
      investigations increases, a new opportunity has emerged to understand factors
      driving drug repositioning through systematic analyses of drugs, drug targets and
      associated disease indications. However, such analyses have so far been hampered 
      by the lack of a centralized knowledgebase, benchmarking data sets and reporting 
      standards. To address these knowledge and clinical needs, here, we present
      RepurposeDB, a collection of repurposed drugs, drug targets and diseases, which
      was assembled, indexed and annotated from public data. RepurposeDB combines
      information on 253 drugs [small molecules (74.30%) and protein drugs (25.29%)]
      and 1125 diseases. Using RepurposeDB data, we identified pharmacological
      (chemical descriptors, physicochemical features and absorption, distribution,
      metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties), biological (protein domains,
      functional process, molecular mechanisms and pathway cross talks) and
      epidemiological (shared genetic architectures, disease comorbidities and clinical
      phenotype similarities) factors mediating drug repositioning. Collectively,
      RepurposeDB is developed as the reference database for drug repositioning
      investigations. The pharmacological, biological and epidemiological principles of
      drug repositioning identified from the meta-analyses could augment therapeutic
      development.

TI  - Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?
PG  - 1156-1164
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311198 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to analytical algorithms that
      iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without
      being explicitly programmed where to look. These include a family of operations
      encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep
      learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate
      and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where
      traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review
      article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential 
      data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the
      potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of
      cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the
      development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide
      clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely
      phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning
      algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a
      machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data
      heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of
      machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A
      critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and
      tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of 
      big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate
      optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses,
      intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to influence nearly every
      aspect of the human condition, and cardiology is not an exception to this trend. 
      This paper provides a guide for clinicians on relevant aspects of artificial
      intelligence and machine learning, reviews selected applications of these methods
      in cardiology to date, and identifies how cardiovascular medicine could
      incorporate artificial intelligence in the future. In particular, the paper first
      reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature
      selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it
      discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected
      applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the
      advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised
      learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in
      cardiovascular medicine, and then explains how these methods could be applied to 
      enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - A Network-Biology Informed Computational Drug Repositioning Strategy to Target
      Disease Risk Trajectories and Comorbidities of Peripheral Artery Disease.
PG  - 108-117
AB  - Currently, drug discovery approaches focus on the design of therapies that
      alleviate an index symptom by reengineering the underlying biological mechanism
      in agonistic or antagonistic fashion. For example, medicines are routinely
      developed to target an essential gene that drives the disease mechanism.
      Therapeutic overloading where patients get multiple medications to reduce the
      primary and secondary side effect burden is standard practice. This
      single-symptom based approach may not be scalable, as we understand that diseases
      are more connected than random and molecular interactions drive disease
      comorbidities. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept drug discovery
      strategy by combining network biology, disease comorbidity estimates, and
      computational drug repositioning, by targeting the risk factors and comorbidities
      of peripheral artery disease, a vascular disease associated with high morbidity
      and mortality. Individualized risk estimation and recommending disease sequelae
      based therapies may help to lower the mortality and morbidity of peripheral
      artery disease.

AB  - Precision medicine can utilize new techniques in order to more effectively
      translate research findings into clinical practice. In this article, we first
      explore the limitations of traditional study designs, which stem from (to name a 
      few): massive cost for the assembly of large patient cohorts; non-representative 
      patient data; and the astounding complexity of human biology. Second, we propose 
      that harnessing electronic health records and mobile device biometrics coupled to
      longitudinal data may prove to be a solution to many of these problems by
      capturing a 'real world' phenotype. We envision that future biomedical research
      utilizing more precise approaches to patient care will utilize continuous and
      longitudinal data sources.

PG  - e2452

AB  - Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disease associated with
      persistently elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      which ultimately leads to greatly increased rates of atherosclerosis and
      cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis progression can be clinically
      approximated through measurement of coronary artery calcification (CAC). CAC can 
      be measured via electron beam computed tomography (EBCT), multi-slice computed
      tomography (MSCT), or contrast-enhanced CT coronary angiography (CTCA). Here, we 
      present the case of a 72-year-old man with known FH and established
      hypercholesterolemia who has consistently tested negative for any significant
      CAC.

TI  - Automated disease cohort selection using word embeddings from Electronic Health
      Records.
PG  - 145-156
AB  - Accurate and robust cohort definition is critical to biomedical discovery using
      Electronic Health Records (EHR). Similar to prospective study designs, high
      quality EHR-based research requires rigorous selection criteria to designate
      case/control status particular to each disease. Electronic phenotyping
      algorithms, which are manually built and validated per disease, have been
      successful in filling this need. However, these approaches are time-consuming,
      leading to only a relatively small amount of algorithms for diseases developed.
      Methodologies that automatically learn features from EHRs have been used for
      cohort selection as well. To date, however, there has been no systematic analysis
      of how these methods perform against current gold standards. Accordingly, this
      paper compares the performance of a state-of-the-art automated feature learning
      method to extracting research-grade cohorts for five diseases against their
      established electronic phenotyping algorithms. In particular, we use word2vec to 
      create unsupervised embeddings of the phenotype space within an EHR system. Using
      medical concepts as a query, we then rank patients by their proximity in the
      embedding space and automatically extract putative disease cohorts via a distance
      threshold. Experimental evaluation shows promising results with average F-score
      of 0.57 and AUC-ROC of 0.98. However, we noticed that results varied considerably
      between diseases, thus necessitating further investigation and/or
      phenotype-specific refinement of the approach before being readily deployed
      across all diseases.

TI  - Causal inference on electronic health records to assess blood pressure treatment 
      targets: an application of the parametric g formula.
PG  - 180-191
AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular disease and
      cerebrovascular disease, which are respectively the primary and secondary most
      common causes of morbidity and mortality across the globe. To alleviate the risks
      of hypertension, there are a number of effective antihypertensive drugs
      available. However, the optimal treatment blood pressure goal for
      antihypertensive therapy remains an area of controversy. The results of the
      recent Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, which found
      benefits for intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure, have been debated for
      several reasons. We aimed to assess the benefits of treating to four different
      blood pressure targets and to compare our results to those of SPRINT using a
      method for causal inference called the parametric g formula. We applied this
      method to blood pressure measurements obtained from the electronic health records
      of approximately 200,000 patients who visited the Mount Sinai Hospital in New
      York, NY. We simulated the effect of four clinically relevant dynamic treatment
      regimes, assessing the effectiveness of treating to four different blood pressure
      targets: 150 mmHg, 140 mmHg, 130 mmHg, and 120 mmHg. In contrast to current
      American Heart Association guidelines and in concordance with SPRINT, we find
      that targeting 120 mmHg systolic blood pressure is significantly associated with 
      decreased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Causal inference
      methods applied to electronic methods are a powerful and flexible technique and
      medicine may benefit from their increased usage.

AB  - Residual atherothrombotic risk remains higher in patients with versus without
      diabetes mellitus (DM) despite statin therapy. The underlying mechanisms are
      unclear. This is a retrospective post-hoc analysis of the YELLOW II trial,
      comparing patients with and without DM (non-DM) who received rosuvastatin 40 mg
      for 8-12 weeks and underwent intracoronary multimodality imaging of an
      obstructive nonculprit lesion, before and after therapy. In addition, blood
      samples were drawn to assess cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and changes in
      gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). There was a
      significant reduction in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), an increase
      in CEC and beneficial changes in plaque morphology including increase in fibrous 
      cap thickness and decrease in the prevalence of thin cap fibro-atheroma by
      optical coherence tomography in DM and non-DM patients. While differential gene
      expression analysis did not demonstrate differences in PBMC transcriptome between
      the two groups on the single-gene level, weighted gene coexpression network
      analysis revealed two modules of coexpressed genes associated with DM, Collagen
      Module and Platelet Module, related to collagen catabolism and platelet function 
      respectively. Bayesian network analysis revealed key driver genes within these
      modules. These transcriptomic findings might provide potential mechanisms
      responsible for the higher cardiovascular risk in DM patients.

AB  - The traditional paradigm of cardiovascular disease research derives insight from 
      large-scale, broadly inclusive clinical studies of well-characterized
      pathologies. These insights are then put into practice according to standardized 
      clinical guidelines. However, stagnation in the development of new cardiovascular
      therapies and variability in therapeutic response implies that this paradigm is
      insufficient for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden. In this
      state-of-the-art review, we examine 3 interconnected ideas we put forth as key
      concepts for enabling a transition to precision cardiology: 1) precision
      characterization of cardiovascular disease with machine learning methods; 2) the 
      application of network models of disease to embrace disease complexity; and 3)
      using insights from the previous 2 ideas to enable pharmacology and
      polypharmacology systems for more precise drug-to-patient matching and
      patient-disease stratification. We conclude by exploring the challenges of
      applying a precision approach to cardiology, which arise from a deficit of the
      required resources and infrastructure, and emerging evidence for the clinical
      effectiveness of this nascent approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite extensive evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of
      statins on clinical outcomes, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain
      elusive. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed changes in plaque morphology using
      intravascular imaging, with a comprehensive evaluation of cholesterol efflux
      capacity (CEC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomics in
      patients receiving high-dose statin therapy. METHODS: In a prospective study, 85 
      patients with stable coronary artery disease underwent percutaneous coronary
      intervention for a culprit lesion, followed by intracoronary multimodality
      imaging, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) of an obstructive
      nonculprit lesion. All subjects received 40 mg of rosuvastatin daily for 8 to 12 
      weeks, when the nonculprit lesion was reimaged and intervention performed. Blood 
      samples were drawn at both times to assess CEC and transcriptomic profile in
      PBMC. RESULTS: Baseline OCT minimal fibrous cap thickness (FCT) was 100.9 +/-
      41.7 mum, which increased to 108.6 +/- 39.6 mum at follow-up, and baseline CEC
      was 0.81 +/- 0.14, which increased at follow-up to 0.84 +/- 0.14 (p = 0.003).
      Thin-cap fibroatheroma prevalence decreased from 20.0% to 7.1% (p = 0.003).
      Changes in FCT were independently associated with CEC increase by multivariate
      analysis (beta: 0.30; p = 0.01). PBMC microarray analysis detected 117 genes that
      were differentially expressed at follow-up compared to baseline, including genes 
      playing key roles in cholesterol synthesis (SQLE), regulation of fatty acids
      unsaturation (FADS1), cellular cholesterol uptake (LDLR), efflux (ABCA1 and
      ABCG1), and inflammation (DHCR24). Weighted coexpression network analysis
      revealed unique clusters of genes associated with favorable FCT and CEC changes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated an independent association between fibrous
      cap thickening and improved CEC that may contribute to morphological changes
      suggesting plaque stabilization among patients taking intensive statin therapy.
      Furthermore, the significant perturbations in PBMC transcriptome may help
      determine the beneficial effects of statin on plaque stabilization. (Reduction in

TI  - PREDICTIVE MODELING OF HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL
      RECORD-WIDE MACHINE LEARNING: A CASE-STUDY USING MOUNT SINAI HEART FAILURE
      COHORT.
PG  - 276-287
LID - 10.1142/9789813207813_0027 [doi]
AB  - Reduction of preventable hospital readmissions that result from chronic or acute 
      conditions like stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction and pneumonia
      remains a significant challenge for improving the outcomes and decreasing the
      cost of healthcare delivery in the United States. Patient readmission rates are
      relatively high for conditions like heart failure (HF) despite the implementation
      of high-quality healthcare delivery operation guidelines created by regulatory
      authorities. Multiple predictive models are currently available to evaluate
      potential 30-day readmission rates of patients. Most of these models are
      hypothesis driven and repetitively assess the predictive abilities of the same
      set of biomarkers as predictive features. In this manuscript, we discuss our
      attempt to develop a data-driven, electronic-medical record-wide (EMR-wide)
      feature selection approach and subsequent machine learning to predict readmission
      probabilities. We have assessed a large repertoire of variables from electronic
      medical records of heart failure patients in a single center. The cohort included
      1,068 patients with 178 patients were readmitted within a 30-day interval (16.66%
      readmission rate). A total of 4,205 variables were extracted from EMR including
      diagnosis codes (n=1,763), medications (n=1,028), laboratory measurements
      (n=846), surgical procedures (n=564) and vital signs (n=4). We designed a
      multistep modeling strategy using the Naive Bayes algorithm. In the first step,
      we created individual models to classify the cases (readmitted) and controls
      (non-readmitted). In the second step, features contributing to predictive risk
      from independent models were combined into a composite model using a
      correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. All models were trained and
      tested using a 5-fold cross-validation method, with 70% of the cohort used for
      training and the remaining 30% for testing. Compared to existing predictive
      models for HF readmission rates (AUCs in the range of 0.6-0.7), results from our 
      EMR-wide predictive model (AUC=0.78; Accuracy=83.19%) and phenome-wide feature
      selection strategies are encouraging and reveal the utility of such datadriven
      machine learning. Fine tuning of the model, replication using multi-center
      cohorts and prospective clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility would
      help the adoption of the model as a clinical decision system for evaluating
      readmission status.

TI  - Medical student preparedness for an era of personalized medicine: findings from
      one US medical school.
PG  - 129-141
AB  - AIM: The objective of this research was to assess medical student preparedness
      for the use of personalized medicine. MATERIALS & METHODS: A survey instrument
      measuring attitude toward personalized medicine, perceived knowledge of genomic
      testing concepts and perceived ability to apply genomics to clinical care was
      distributed to students in medical school (MS) years 1-4. RESULTS: Of 212
      participants, 79% felt that it was important to learn about personalized
      medicine, but only 6% thought that their medical education had adequately
      prepared them to practice personalized medicine. Attitude did not vary across
      years; knowledge and ability increased after MS1, but not after MS2. CONCLUSION: 
      While medical students support the use of personalized medicine, they do not feel
      prepared to apply genomics to clinical care.

TI  - Comparison of the genome sequences of "Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum" primary
      endosymbionts of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci B and Q biotypes.
PG  - 1757-9
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02976-12 [doi]
AB  - "Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum" is the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies. We
      report two complete genome sequences of this bacterium from the worldwide
      invasive B and Q biotypes of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Differences in the two 
      genome sequences may add insights into the complex differences in the biology of 
      both biotypes.
